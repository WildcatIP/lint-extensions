# lint-extensions
A few simple lint extensions useful for verifying the loop-android code.

## Supported features
* Immutablity verification
* Enforced nullity annotations
* Enforced 'final' for method parameters
* Blacklisting methods, base classes, annotations

## Not supported (yet)
* JavaDoc gag checking

## Prior art and inspiration
* Inspired by nearly identical checks I encountered while working at Twitter
